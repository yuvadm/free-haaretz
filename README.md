# Free Haaretz

A nefarious browser extension that easily bypasses the Haaretz paywall.

If things aren't working as expected, make sure to reinstall (update) the extension from time to time, to make sure you have the latest code.

## Install

Installation has to be done manually. I'm not interested in distributing this extension in the Mozilla / Google addon 'stores'.

### Firefox

 1. Download the [add-on XPI file](https://github.com/yuvadm/free-haaretz/releases/download/v0.9.6/free-haaretz.xpi)

 2. Firefox should automatically identify the XPI file and request permission to install it.
 
 3. Click **Allow** and then **Install** to install the extension.

### Chrome / Chromium

 1. Download the [extension ZIP file](https://github.com/yuvadm/free-haaretz/releases/download/v0.9.6/free-haaretz.zip)

 2. Unzip the file.

 3. In Google Chrome (or Chromium), in the address bar go to [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions)

 4. In the top right corner, click to enable **Developer Mode**.

 5. Click the **Load unpacked extension** button.

 6. Navigate to the folder you unziped your code to, and select it.

 7. The **FreeHaaretz** extension should now be loaded.
